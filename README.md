# Presidential Inauguration Speeches: Unification or Polarization? 
By _Data Destroyers (Karan Rawat - leader, Kelsey Matsik, Emma Mills, Emily Macris)_



## Contents of Repository
This repository contains all the work for Project 1 of Prototyping which has the goal of working with text data. Specifcally, the goal of the repository is to answer the question: 
_Is there a relationship between the party of the presidential elect (Democratic or Republican) and the primary type of language used in their inaugural speech (polarizing or unifying)?_<br>




## Section 1 -- Software and Platform
Throughout this project we used Github, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code and Python. The packages we used were pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, requests, and bs4 (Beautiful Soup). 
All of these packages would have to be downloaded in order to run the notebooks. Both Windows and Mac were used to complete this project.

## Section 3 -- Reproducing the Results

1. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/KaranRawatUVA/ds4002_project1.git)
2. First go to the python notebook _scraping.ipynb_ and run each code box in order. This will produce the data set.
4. Now go to the python notebook _EDA.ipynb_ and run each code box in order. This will produce data visualization.
5. Lastly, go to the python notebook _analysis.ipynb_ and run each code box in order. This will produce the statistical analysis.
